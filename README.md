# hometeq

This repo includes tutorials that I have completed related to the server side web development module in second year at IIT.

See [apps.kushan.info/hometeq](http://apps.kushan.info/hometeq/) for live demo.

### Installation

hometeq requires [Apache web server](https://httpd.apache.org) and [MySql](https://www.mysql.com) to run. Alternatively you can use [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) to run hometeq project.


Import db.sql to your MySql database before run the project.

Configure db.php according to your MySql server.

```php
$servername = "localhost";
$username = ""; // Replace with MySql username
$password = ""; // Replace with MySql user password
$db = ""; // Replace db name you are hope to use with this project
```
